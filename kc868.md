chose “ESP32-S3” and workMode=“develop”  loadMode: “usb” item.



![esp32-s3](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image002.png)

c. Chose KCS v2 firmware BIN file and COM
port then begin download. Total 5 steps.

2. Use ethernet cable or WiFi config setting.

![esp32 download tool](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image003.png)

a. use ethernet cable connect board to your
router, make sure your computer also connect with same router, just all in one
local network.b. Power on of your board, you can use KinCony scan device tool to find output
board IP address.

![scan device](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image137.jpg)

Total 5 steps to find out IP address.

Step-1: chose your computer network adapter
when you are using.

Step-2: chose your computer IP address
item.

Step-3: click “StartMonitorPort” button.

Step-4: click “SCAN” button.

Step-5: board’s ethernet or WiFi IP address
, ID and type name will be listed.



If you first time power on , you board will
be found by ethernet IP address. Because your WiFi is work as “AP” mode as
default. After you config your WiFi as “STA” mode, you will find out the WiFi
IP address by KinCony scan device tool.

You can use ethernet IP address login by
web browser to config board setting.



Note: if you want config only by WiFi, when
power on, your computer will find the “AP” hotspot, WiFi signal named “board
name” + “ID”.



![ap](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image006.png)

Let your computer connect to the “AP”, it’s
without password, after you connected, just usehttp://192.168.4.1to login by webpage.

[http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1)

If you can’t see the “AP”, you can “hold
on” board’s function button (ESP32 GPIO0) >10 seconds, then board will be
set to factory, default state is “AP”.



![iot login](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image007.png)

You can login webpage by ethernet IP or
WiFi IP. Here is sample login by ethernet IP address 192.168.1.200

Login user name and password default are
“admin”  “admin”



![home page](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image138.jpg)

You can see this home page.Some
parameters are shown.



![input webpage](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image139.jpg)

Here is INPUT webpage. Set every digital
input port how to work with OUTPUT ports.



“Reverse Level”: if checked, the effective
level at the digital input port becomes inverted. Just digital input use by
“HIGH” or “LOW” level. Usually digital input port short with GND = trigger.



![output type](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image140.jpg)

Here is OUTPUT webpage.



![output type](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image014.png)

“hold on”: keep the state after turn ON/OFF

“delay”:  after you turn ON digital
output, will auto turn OFF after a “delay time” you have preset.

“jogging”: when hold on the INPUT with GND,
digital output is ON, release INPUT with GND, digital output will be OFF right
now.



![interlock](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image141.jpg)

“Interlock group”: set interlock group for
digital output. If set to “0” , disable interlock function. If “Output1” set to
“1” and “Output2” set to “1” = Output1 and Output2 work with interlock. If
“Output3” set to “2” and “Output4” set to “2” = Output3 and Output4 work with
interlock. For example , KC868-A64 have 64 channel digital output, so total
will have 64/2=32 interlock groups.



![rf 433](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image142.jpg)

![ir](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image152.jpg)



![sensor](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image153.jpg)

Here is sensor webpage. You can set
different sensor model for 1-wire GPIO ports.

Temperature Threshold:

If the preset difference is exceeded,
temperature data will be auto updated.

For example: “Temperature Threshold”
=2  now temperature is 28°C, so next time , when new temperature is
>30°C(28+2) or <26°C(28-2) will update.



Humidity Threshold:

If the preset difference is exceeded,
humidity data will be auto updated.

For example: “Humidity Threshold” =10 
now humidity is 75%, so next time , when new humidity is >85%(75+10) or
<65%(75-10) will update.



![iot monitor](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image154.jpg)

Here is monitor webpage.



![protocol monitor](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image155.jpg)

Monitor all protocol work state, whether
have connect to server or have a client have connected.



![adc](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image156.jpg)

Monitor ADC value.

In order to easily view the values of each
sensor, we can set a separate sensor channel name, range, display unit, and
automatically reported threshold for each sensor.

Just click “gear” image, will show the
config page.



![adc setting](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image157.jpg)

Fox example, we set a water level analog
sensor, name is “water level”, unit is M (meter), Custom value1 and value2
means: if you are using DC 0-5v analog sensor, when sensor voltage is 0v,
what’s “Custom value1” corresponding value. when sensor voltage is 5v, what’s
“Custom value2” corresponding value.

So sensor dc 0-5v — convert à 0-3 meter

If you are using sensor 4-20mA, so 4-20mA
4mA=Custom value1, 20mA is Custom value2.



![adc](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image158.jpg)

Then you will see the actually sensor name
, value and unit on the monitor webpage.



![input rename](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image159.jpg)

Double click on the input name’s TEXT can
be rename by yourself.



![rename](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image160.jpg)

After renamed.



![output rename](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image161.jpg)

Use the same way (double click TEXT) can
rename of the output ports.



![monitor sensor state](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image162.jpg)

Green ico for INPUT means triggered.

Here is protocol setting webpage. You can
enable/disable different protocol in webpage. About these protocol document you
can download from KinCony’s webpage.



![tuya protocol](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image118.png)

If you want to use Tuya mobile phone
application by remote monitor and control output by internet. You can contact
us order the Tuya licence code. If you bought Tuya licence from KinCony, you
just fill product id, device id, device secret, bind code to this webpage, then
it will auto generate QR code, you can scan QR code add board to Tuya mobile
phone application.

If your board have 4G SIM7600 module, you
can use Tuya app by GPRS.Just enable it for Tuya.



![tuya app](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image192.jpg)



![custom protocol](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image193.jpg)

Here is custom protocols webpage.

You can create message for TCP Client, UDP
Client, RS232, RS485, HTTP GET, HTTP POST different ways.

If “HEX” options is not checked, will send
message by ANSI String.

Fox example:

If you want send a TCP string command to
another relay module to turn ON relay1:



![custom protocol tcp](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image194.jpg)



![tcp client](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image195.jpg)

Make sure have enabled TCP Client protocol,
remote address: 192.168.1.215 port: 4196 is another relay board.

So the string “RELAY-SET-255,1,1” will send
to IP:192.168.1.215 port: 4196 device by TCP.

Fox example:



![Interface gráfica do usuário, Aplicativo

Descrição gerada automaticamente](how%20to%20use_arquivos/image196.jpg)

This means:

send HTTP command string

“http://192.168.1.200/sw_ctl.cgi?Relay01=ON&postpwd=abcd”
by HTTP GET way. If you need add some message with HTTP command, just fill the
“Message” edit box.



![Interface gráfica do usuário, Aplicativo
